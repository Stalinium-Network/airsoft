Rules v1.0

The goal of this RULES is to provide current and future participants with a collection of rules and approved best practices. This guide is based on proven tactics, techniques, and procedures. Zone 37 reserves the right to change any of these rules and communicate them to our participants prior to or during the event to ensure the high quality and safety of our event is maintained.

Treat all event participants with respect and dignity. Our events are designed to provide you with a fun experience. Even if it looks like one side is winning, the organizers will do everything possible to create a balanced scenario that will bring pleasure to all players. There are no winners and therefore no need to get competitive. Enjoy your role!

## Introduction

Zone 37 is a 40-hour continuous airsoft role-playing event set in a constantly changing lore. Each game is a continuation of the previous one and affects the main storyline. You can be a penniless bandit, a treasure hunter, a trader, a soldier, or a PMC mercenary. The choice is yours. Enjoy your role and contribute to the story of Zone 37!

Each player has a profile in our electronic system. Players can earn in-game reputation, money and join squads or entire organizations that have their own goals in Zone 37. All this will be useful to you during the game and when participating in giveaways where we give airsoft guns and gear.

# General Safety Rules

### Non-negotiables

These are the most important rules that all participants, spectators, and staff must abide by. These rules are not negotiable. Failure to comply with these rules may result in a permanent ban from our games.

#### GOLDEN RULE

- We do not tolerate cheaters of any kind. If you are an unstable person and unable to play by the rules, respect other participants, and constantly ruin the gameplay, please refrain from participating in our games. Sooner or later we will identify you and permanently ban you.

- Whenever in doubt about how to act or behave in any situation not specifically mentioned within this rule set, always use your best judgment to keep within the spirit of the event. Don’t “game” the event, go with the flow and enjoy the experience.

- Disrespect of the staff or other participants will not be tolerated. Participants found cheating or disrespecting the staff and other participants will be ejected from the event without a refund.

- Participants who attempt to steal, cause bodily harm, or break any other laws will be handed over to local law enforcement officials.

#### EYE PROTECTION

ANSI Z87.1-1989-rated full-seal to-your-face glasses, goggles, or masks are required to be worn at all times during the event. Mesh eyewear is not allowed. Make sure to wear comfortable glasses as the only times you can remove them are in the safety of your tent or designated safe zones.

#### HEARING PROTECTION

Hearing protection should be worn at all times. You could be subject to noises in excess of 120 dbs at any time during an event. This includes but is not limited to loud sirens, alarms, and commercial 1.4 C pyro (such as Enola Gaye products.). Zone 37 will not be responsible for injuries caused by participants who choose not to use hearing protection during the event. Any military style hearing protection is appropriate however foam earplugs work just fine.

#### DEAD RAGS

All players MUST carry two dead rags (HIGH VIS RED, ORANGE, PINK, YELLOW - You cannot wear gear of these colors) on them at all times and store them in two separate locations. This rule ensures that if one dead rag is lost the player will not create confusion being “dead” without an available dead rag for their head. DO NOT wear RED head coverings as this can be confusing while you are alive. Dead Rags will be no smaller than 12" x 12".

#### LASERS AND FLASHLIGHTS

Strobes and lasers of any kind are strictly prohibited in these games. You can use regular flashlights attached to your replicas.

#### AGE RESTRICTIONS

We do not allow participants younger than 18 at our events. All participants must sign out a waiver before each game. Our events are designed for a mature audience and require a level of self-control and respect not typically found in minors.

#### HYDRATION

All players are required to have one quart (1 liter, 2 disposable bottles) of water capacity with them at all times on the field. If you are not hydrated for this event, you will have a very bad time.

#### REAL-WORLD WEAPONS

No actual weapons should be brought to an event. This includes bladed weapons, firearms, tasers, etc. Utility tools and knives with blades under 6” are permitted for camping purposes. Disregarding this is grounds for immediate expulsion from the event and a permanent ban from our games. You must also adhere to all local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

#### CAMPFIRES

Campfires are NOT allowed but you can use camping cans/stoves on stones or clear ground without any dry grass or leaves and observe all fire safety rules. Double check with your faction leadership before starting and never leave burning cans/stoves unattended.

#### ALCOHOL, DRUGS AND GLASS BOTTLES

Intoxication is not allowed. Behave responsibly and obey the law or you will be ejected from the experience. Glass bottles are not allowed on the playing field due to the hazard they pose should they become litter.

#### TRASH

Put trash in designated trash receptacles only when on the field. If camping on-site, bag all trash for your campsite and take the trash to the dumpsters or designated trash pick-up sites. If the organizer catches you littering, you will be fined.

#### LOST AND FOUND

If you come across any items that another participant obviously dropped, please pick them up and turn them in to the event staff so they may be returned to their rightful owner. Zone 37 is not responsible for items left on the field after event staff clear the site.

## General Rules

### RESPAWN AND MEDICS

- If you have been hit, you must shout “HIT” as loudly as possible. Stage death and falling to the ground are encouraged. Let the opponent know that you have been hit, otherwise, you risk getting hit again.

- Once hit, you are “down” and must place a red “dead rag” on your head. You have 5 minutes before you “bleed out”. All you can do for those 5 minutes is yell “medic.” DO NOT adjust gear, remain seated, and DO NOT test fire your replica. You can confuse your opponent and get hit again. After a second hit (or third if you have a special artifact) and 5 minutes of “bleeding out” you are “dead”.

- You are required to carry a tourniquet with you so that you can be treated. You are allowed to have one tourniquet (will be issued).

- Any player can heal “downed” players back to life by wrapping a tourniquet around their hand.

- After a second hit and 5 minutes of waiting, you must return to the closest respawn (hospital, base, or trader).

- Medics can heal dead players using medic water

- A player must fully drink the bottle to come back to life!

- Any player can be a medic. Military factions have one medic per squad. Civilians are medics by default if they have medic water on them.

- Medics may not shoot or move while healing a dead player.

- Anyone can move a dead player (friendly or not) by maintaining physical contact. When moving a dead player, you can only use a pistol.

- Medic cannot revive himself with medic water!

### SAFE ZONES, HOSPITALS AND TRADERS

- Hospitals are special places with medic water.

- Hospitals are only accessible to Civilians.

- Field Traders (civilians with green armbands) also serve as respawn points for any player.

- Hospitals, Traders, and small marked areas around them are safe zones. You may not shoot into or from these zones. Violating this rule will result in immediate suspension from the event.

### RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

Try to aim for center mass when possible. Blind firing is not allowed, weapons should always be shouldered and players should have the ability to aim down sights when firing. All weapons must be on semi-auto inside of buildings.

### CHRONOGRAPH

Every time you come to our games, you must get your gun chronoed, even if you've been chronoed before.

---

## Weapon Class Qualifications

### RIFLEMAN

The backbone of any squad, the Rifleman is generally the most flexible class which many players will find their airsoft guns suited for. Rifles are classified as airsoft guns which replicate intermediate or full-power caliber rifles.

Examples of rifleman class weapons include M4, AK, SCAR, AR15, ACR, G36, etc. SMGs are also considered Rifleman class weapons but have their specific limitations (see “Weapon Restrictions” table).

### MMG/LMG

The Medium/Light Machine Gunner is the most common sustained fire solution for any squad. MMG/LMGs are replicas of belt-fed dedicated machine guns that have seen military service and may use drum or box magazines. LMGs not in the original military configuration must have a feed tray and be incapable of accepting standard AEG magazines to use box or drum magazines.

MMG/LMGs may only use fully automatic fire indoors to engage targets that are fully outside of the structure they are in.

Examples: M249, RPD, Stoner 63, Mk43, Mk48, M240, PKM, M60 etc.

### MARKSMAN

The Marksman is the long-range precision weapons class. Marksman rifles must use non-winding low or mid-capacity magazines only. All Marksmen MUST carry a Handgun as a sidearm. Marksman rifles are mechanically semi-auto-locked replicas. May only be used indoors if shooting outdoors at a target outside their MED.

Examples: M110, SR-25, M24, SVD Dragunov, L96, VSS Vintorez, Mk12 SPR, etc.

AR15, M4, and AK, even with a long barrel and a silencer, ARE NOT DMR! Real-world DMR replicas that do not meet length requirements must be in the correct military configuration. All marksman rifles must have a stock.

### SNIPER

The Sniper is the long-range precision weapons class. Sniper rifles must use non-winding low or mid-capacity magazines only. All Snipers MUST carry a Handgun as a sidearm. Sniper rifles are only bolt action replicas with magnified optic and 18-inch one-piece barrels. Real-world sniper replicas that do not meet length requirements must be in the correct military configuration. All sniper rifles must have a stock. May only be used indoors if shooting outdoors at a target outside their MED.

#### SIDEARMS

Sidearms are secondary weapons that may be carried by any player as a supplement to any weapons class. Sidearms must be handgun, revolver, or breacher shotgun-type weapons. Handguns in a chassis system also fall into the sidearm class.

Sidearms must use non-winding, weapon-specific magazines. Sidearms must not have adapters to use AEG rifle magazines or drum or box magazines. Extended-type magazines made for handguns are approved. All optic, flashlight, and muzzle device configurations are approved.

Any handgun-type weapon with no stock or any handgun weapon in a chassis kit can be carried as a sidearm. Examples include Glock, 1911, Hi Capa, Sig, USW, USW-G, FLUX Raider, Revolvers, etc. SMG-type replicas cannot be your sidearm!

Any spring or gas-powered shotgun replica without a stock may be carried as a sidearm. Examples include M870 Breacher, M3, M500 Shockwave, etc. Sidearms must pass the Standard 1.5 joules energy limit and are limited to semi-auto only with no minimum engagement distance.

---

## Grenades, smoke, and simulated explosives

No outside grenades or simulated explosives are allowed for our events. Smoke Grenades of any color are NOT allowed. Grenades and simulated explosives that utilize gas to create a loud report upon detonation have a kill radius of 15 feet from impact.

Simulated explosives that eject BBs will have those BBs count as hits. Launchers consist of simulated grenade or rocket-launching weapons, such as the RPG-7, AT4, M-72, LAW, M203, M320, or GP-25. Launchers have a MED of 100 Ft.

- Participants are not authorized to bring or use any kind of pyrotechnics.  
- Homemade pyrotechnics are not authorized.  
- You will be able to purchase grenades and smokes during a game if weather and other conditions allow it.

---

## Melee Weapons

No real-life knives on the field! The player may carry dummy melee weapons like rubber knives or swords. Each melee weapon must be presented during chrono of your primary airsoft replica. To “hit” a player you should always use the broad side of the blade and just gently touch the player. Never stab with the sharp end of a dummy knife, because even a rubber dummy knife is quite hard and can cause injury.

If you want to use such a weapon, then this weapon must meet the following requirements:

- The tip of the blade of the dummy knife must be blunt!
- The blade should bend if adequate force is applied.
- The melee weapon must be attached to your gear (you cannot carry it in your backpack).
- The melee weapon must be marked as having passed chrono. Failure to display the sticker will result in your immediate removal and permanent ban from our games without a refund.

### INSTANT DEATH

If you are hit with a melee weapon, you are considered "dead" immediately. You need a medic or you need to return to the nearest respawn point.

---

## Factions and Leadership

---

### PMC RUBICON

The paramilitary association of former special forces officers from the Eastern Bloc and other Slavic countries. They are distinguished by their brutal approach to achieving their goals. They do not disdain to do dirty work and are ready to go to the end. Rules of Engagement (ROE) states that we may not open fire until fired upon, however, this will only apply to Civilians present in Zone 37.

**Leadership and objectives**: The faction has a stationary base, a commander, and squads subordinate to him. A squad cannot have less than 4 people. Each squad must have a medic and a squad leader. Each squad itself assigns these roles to its members. As a PMC operator, you see Zone 37 as a source of profit and a good place for illegal trade. Therefore, you will not allow anyone to establish control over it. Your PMC is even ready to launch a nuclear strike on Zone 37, to keep control over it. You receive specific orders from your commander as the game progresses.

**Appearance**: Green-based Russian camo (Pixel, ATACS-FG, Gorka, M81 Woodland, Marpat Woodland, Jungle Tiger Stripes). The top and bottom must match. No black headgear, plate carriers, or chest rigs, and pouches on them. Black pistol holsters and leg plates are allowed. Multicam and OD gear are allowed.

**Airsoft Replicas**: There are no restrictions, but it is recommended to use airsoft replicas of Russian and Eastern Bloc weapons.

---

### PMC TITANS

An American private military company consisting predominantly of former (and possibly active) CIA agents. Despite being funded by the American government for homeland security and conducting “dirty work” outside the American borders, PMC Titans is being investigated after a situation that happened in Zone 16 in May 2022. Records show that PMC Titans have allegedly committed war crimes including (but not limited to) the shooting of unarmed civilians, mutilation of corpses, and false surrendering. No one knows their real purpose for being in Zone 37 nowadays.

**Leadership and objectives**: The faction has a stationary base, a commander, and squads subordinate to him. A squad cannot have less than 4 people. Each squad must have a medic and squad leader. Each squad itself assigns these roles to its members. As a PMC operator, you strive to establish your authority over Zone 37 and provide your scientists with everything they need to develop advanced military technologies. You receive specific orders from your commander as the game progresses.

**Appearance**: Tan-based American camo (Multicam, Arid Multicam, AOR1, Desert Marpat, DCU, Chocolate Chip). The top and bottom must match. No black headgear, plate carriers, or chest rigs, and pouches on them. Black pistol holsters and leg plates are allowed. Tan, coyote brown, and OD gear are allowed.

**Airsoft Replicas**: There are no restrictions, but it is advisable to use airsoft replicas of US/NATO weapons.

---

### UNITED GLOBAL FORCES

The United Global Forces (UGF) are military forces from European countries, Africa, South America, and Australia. They strive to maintain order and prevent conflicts from spreading beyond Zone 37.

**Leadership and objectives**: The faction has multiple checkpoints on the field, a commander, and squads subordinate to him. A squad cannot have less than 4 people. Each squad must have a medic and a squad leader. Each squad itself assigns these roles to its members. As a UGF operator, you are a government employee and your job is to maintain order in Zone 37 and stop any illegal trade in artifacts outside the city. You receive specific orders from your commander as the game progresses.

**Appearance**: Any black camo or clothes. The top and bottom must match. Headgear, plate carriers, chest rigs, and pouches on them can be of any camo.

**Airsoft Replicas**: All allowed.

---

### CIVILIANS

Who said you can't just make money there? Zone 37 attracts all sorts of people from all over the world, including bounty hunters, treasure hunters, traders, doctors, and just onlookers who are not averse to making money peacefully, or not quite peacefully…

**Leadership and objectives**: The faction has no base, commander, or squads. Players can team up at their discretion. As a civilian, you can search for artifacts and caches, trade with Traders and among your faction. You CAN revive players (if you have medic water on you), team up with one of the PMCs, but you CANNOT team up with the UGF. You can betray everyone (including your faction) to achieve your goals. But keep in mind, that reputation is hard to earn and very easy to lose. Betray your friends wisely!

**Appearance**: ANY civilian clothes, jeans, shirts, hoodies, etc. Preferred colors: grey, green, brown, etc. NO CAMO PATTERNS! NO BLACK CLOTHES! The clothes don't have to be combat-style. The top and bottom may NOT match. Homemade post-apocalyptic costumes are very welcome!

**Faction Roles**:  
Once you choose a role at the beginning of the game, you cannot change it. Choose wisely!

- Treasure Hunter (yellow armband): An armed civilian who came to the zone in search of profit.  
- Field Trader (green armband): A civilian who decided to achieve his goals not by shooting, but through illegal trade, kidnapping, and other dirty deeds. Field Traders also serve as respawn points for any player.  
- Medics (white armband): A civilian who carries medic water and can revive any “dead” players.

**Airsoft Replicas**: All allowed. NO attachments except flashlights.

---

## Game Items and Tools

### MEDIC WATER

16.9 oz (0.5L) water in the plastic bottle. You are allowed to bring these water bottles with you to the field. Medic water can be taken from hospitals, bought from Traders, or taken from your faction base. Water in your camelback, thermos, or a gallon bottle does not qualify as medic water!

Supplies of medic water at collection points are replenished by the organizers.

Don't litter. Don’t throw away empty plastic bottles. Take your trash to the base or the city! You will be immediately removed from the game and permanently banned for such violation.

### ARES ALPHA APP

We use the Ares Alpha app to coordinate actions during the game. Every player on the field is required to have this app and be online. This is your map, this is your communication center and management objectives.

**Ares Alpha IOS app link**  
**Ares Alpha ANDROID app link**

### CURRENCY

Doubloons (DB) are an in-game currency. Doubloons can be earned by selling artifacts and by completing contracts and missions.

Since paper money was very ineffective in Zone 37, the locals decided to use physical crypto-coins for all transactions in Zone 37. With this money, you can buy ammo, grenades, artifacts, access to closed areas, or bribe opponents to achieve your personal goals.

All doubloons left on your hands by the end of the game will be credited to your faction for the next event, you can use this to gain an advantage! Saving is profitable!

### LOCKBOXES

A protected container that cannot be looted from a "downed" or "dead" player. You can carry no more than one artifact or 200 BB’s bag in the lockbox.

A lockbox can be bought from the Trader. There is a limited number of lockboxes in the game. A lockbox can be sold to other players or back to the Trader.

### ARTIFACTS

Artifacts are collectibles that can be found in Zone 37. These artifacts can be used to complete contracts, fulfill missions, or for the sake of exploiting its power. Artifacts can be sold to the Trader for Doubloons.

- **Slime**  
  Slime is a flat yellow disc with a slight thickening in the center. If a player has this artifact, their bleed-out time is extended by an detailedDescription one minute, giving the player a higher chance of getting revived.  
  **Tier**: 1  
  **Cost**: 5 DB

- **Mama’s Beads**  
  Mama’s Beads looks like a vine with flaming orange beads sticking out from its stems. This artifact provides the player with a chance of being revived once more after being shot. (You must remove and re-attach your tourniquet.)  
  **Tier**: 1  
  **Cost**: 5 DB

- **Spiral**  
  The spiral is a spring-shaped artifact that is grey in color. This artifact gives the player the ability to carry big chests by themselves (which typically would require two people)  
  **Tier**: 1  
  **Cost**: 5 DB

- **Slug**  
  Slug is a green elongated cylinder and looks like a fat caterpillar. This artifact has incredible power and can heal even fatal wounds. (It is equal to medic water. Players can revive dead players but not themselves!)  
  **Tier**: 2  
  **Cost**: 15 DB

- **Crystal**  
  Crystal is a blue artifact that takes the shape of a crystal. This artifact allows the player to travel through one radiated sector or wander through radioactive areas within 8 minutes that otherwise would be impossible without this artifact. Entry to such places is only possible with a guide!  
  **Tier**: 2  
  **Cost**: 15 DB

- **Kolobok**  
  Kolobok is a round brown ball that resembles a sea urchin. This is an extremely rare artifact that is being hunted by PMCs and UGF. This artifact has a decent price tag to its name, meaning that just a few of them could make a man rich! But be careful, because once you find it, you become a target.  
  **Tier**: 3  
  **Cost**: 200 DB

### RESPIRATORS

This is a mask with filters. You are given it when you enter a closed radioactive zone. The mask must be returned to the Guide upon exiting the zone. To enter the zone you pay the fee and bring the Crystal (artifact).

### RADIOACTIVE AREAS

Special closed areas that can only be accessed with a Guide. To do this, you must pay a fee and bring a Crystal (artifact). In these areas, you can try your luck and find a stash of valuable items, or even win a new airsoft replica!

### STASHES

There are hidden chests on the field that can contain ammo, medic water, airsoft replicas, food, and artifacts. The more difficult the chest is to access, the more useful its contents.

All chests are locked. Only your commander at your base or the Trader in the Сity can open the chest. Do not attempt to break into or damage the chest. You will be immediately removed from the game and permanently banned for such violation.

Chests with one handle can be carried by one person. Chests with two handles must be carried by two people. You can use only the sidearm while carrying the chest. So, it wouldn't hurt to always have a sidearm on you.

Players who find the chest distribute its contents among themselves by mutual agreement. If a player finds a chest (which he can carry alone), then all its contents belong to that player. The player has the right to dispose of this content at his own discretion, including sharing it with teammates and allies.

---

## Staff Interactions

There will be organizers, video operators, and volunteers on the field, to whom you can turn for any help. Operators and volunteers will wear reflective vests. The organizers are also active participants and can be identified by the white tape on their sleeves.

For intentionally shooting at people in reflective vests you will be immediately excluded from the event with a subsequent permanent ban.

You will find volunteers at traders, in hospital areas, and at faction bases. For any questions, please contact our staff. Do not try to solve the problem yourself. If you notice any violation of the laws, please contact the organizers directly.
